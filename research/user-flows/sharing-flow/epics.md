# Sharing Flow Epics

## Overview

This document outlines the epics for developing the sharing flow, based on the core MVP features and additional enhancements from mvp-features.md. Epics are high-level user stories or feature groups, broken into smaller tasks for implementation. They align with the iterated flow in overview.md, prioritizing MVP for launch and additional features for post-launch iterations.

## MVP Epics (Launch-Ready)

These epics cover the essential features for a functional sharing flow MVP, focusing on privacy, basic usability, and motivation.

1. **Epic: Photo Capture & Initiation**
   - **User Story**: As a user, I want to take a photo of an item in a shop to start the sharing process.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement full-screen camera view with centered frame.
     - Add [Capture] and [Cancel] buttons with basic haptic feedback.
     - Ensure portrait orientation and thumb-friendly design.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Photo captures successfully; flow proceeds to tagging.
   - **Effort**: 1 week.

2. **Epic: On-Device AI Tagging**
   - **User Story**: As a user, I want the app to automatically tag my photo for easy identification.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Integrate basic TensorFlow.js model for tag generation.
     - Display photo preview with tags (e.g., "Vintage Scarf").
     - Add [Processing...] indicator and [Edit Tags] button.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Tags generate on-device; no server calls.
   - **Effort**: 2 weeks.

3. **Epic: Tag Review & Editing**
   - **User Story**: As a user, I want to review and edit AI tags before sharing.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create editable tag list with [X] remove and [Add Tag] input.
     - Add [Save] and [Cancel] buttons with >44px targets.
     - Implement swipe gestures for editing.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Users can correct tags; saves to next step.
   - **Effort**: 1 week.

4. **Epic: Basic Privacy & Sharing Decision**
   - **User Story**: As a user, I want to choose whether and how to share my tagged item.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Build modal with [Yes, Share] or [No, Keep Private].
     - Add simple privacy tiers: [Public] or [Private].
     - Integrate with confirmation screen for shares.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Respects user choice; handles private options gracefully.
   - **Effort**: 1 week.

5. **Epic: Notifications & Basic Badges**
   - **User Story**: As a user, I want to receive notifications and badges for my shares.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement notification banner for finds.
     - Create basic badge system (e.g., "Item Shared").
     - Add push notifications with opt-in.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Motivates sharing; enhances community feel.
   - **Effort**: 1 week.

## Additional Epics (Post-MVP)

These epics build on the MVP, adding advanced features for better UX. Implement in phases based on user feedback.

1. **Epic: Accessibility Enhancements**
   - **User Story**: As an elderly user, I want voice-guided and accessible interactions.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Add voice guidance toggle and guided capture.
     - Integrate screen reader support and larger targets.
     - Implement haptic feedback for confirmations.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Inclusive for all personas; no barriers for Eleanor.
   - **Effort**: 2 weeks.

2. **Epic: Advanced AI & Feedback**
   - **User Story**: As a user, I want accurate tags with confidence scores and feedback.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Add confidence scores to tags.
     - Implement thumbs-up/down feedback for model improvement.
     - Integrate voice tagging for multi-modal input.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Improves accuracy for specific items.
   - **Effort**: 3 weeks.

3. **Epic: Expanded Privacy Controls**
   - **User Story**: As a privacy-conscious user, I want granular sharing options.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Expand to [Anonymous] and [Community-Only] tiers.
     - Add expiration timers and opt-in notifications.
     - Include reflection prompts for emotional support.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Full control for sensitive shares.
   - **Effort**: 2 weeks.

4. **Epic: Personalized Gamification**
   - **User Story**: As a user, I want personalized badges and nudges for motivation.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create persona-specific badges (e.g., "Memory Keeper").
     - Add gentle nudges for private options.
     - Implement optional reflection prompts.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Increases engagement without pressure.
   - **Effort**: 2 weeks.

## Implementation Plan

- **Sprint Structure**: MVP epics in 4 sprints (6-8 weeks); additional in 3-4 sprints (8-12 weeks).
- **Dependencies**: AI epic before feedback; privacy before expanded controls.
- **Testing**: End-to-end for each epic with persona scenarios.
- **Risks**: AI accuracy delays MVP; mitigate with basic models.
