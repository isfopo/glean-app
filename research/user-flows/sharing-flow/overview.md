## Design Notes

- **Mobile-First & Accessibility:** Voice guidance, >50px targets, haptic feedback, screen readersâ€”directly addresses Eleanor's barriers.
- **Boho Aesthetic:** Retained earthy colors, but added voice icons and progress bars for modernity.
- **Privacy Emphasis:** Granular controls early in flow reduce vulnerability for Maya/Alex.
- **No Transactions:** Still discovery-focused, with badges as non-monetary incentives.
- **Performance:** Progress indicators and battery-aware throttling for optimizations.

## Alignment with Mission & Personas

- **Maya:** Privacy tiers and voice input reduce time/privacy friction, enhancing "intentional" sharing.
- **Alex:** Precise AI with feedback ensures functional accuracy; community-only sharing protects projects.
- **Eleanor:** Voice/haptics and gentle nudges make flow accessible and emotionally supportive.
