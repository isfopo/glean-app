# Sharing Flow: Key Technology Needs and System Design Analysis

## Overview

This document exports the findings from parsing the `epics.md` file, identifying key technology requirements and system design implications for the sharing flow. The analysis prioritizes privacy-first design, modular implementation, and progressive enhancement across MVP and post-MVP epics.

## Key Technology Needs

### 1. Camera and Media Handling (Photo Capture & Initiation, On-Device AI Tagging)

- **Requirements**: Full-screen camera view with capture controls, portrait orientation, haptic feedback, and on-device image processing for AI tagging (e.g., TensorFlow.js models for object recognition).
- **Technologies**: React Native camera libraries (e.g., react-native-vision-camera or expo-camera), haptic feedback APIs (e.g., expo-haptics or React Native Vibration), and on-device ML inference (TensorFlow.js React Native).

### 2. User Interface and Interaction (Tag Review & Editing, Basic Privacy & Sharing Decision)

- **Requirements**: Editable lists with gestures (swipe, add/remove), modals for privacy decisions, touch-friendly designs (>44px targets), and privacy tiers (Public/Private, expanding to Anonymous/Community-Only).
- **Technologies**: Gesture libraries (react-native-gesture-handler), modal components (React Native Modal), and state management (Zustand).

### 3. Notifications and Gamification (Notifications & Basic Badges, Personalized Gamification)

- **Requirements**: Push notifications with opt-in, in-app banners, badge systems (e.g., "Item Shared"), persona-specific badges, nudges, and reflection prompts.
- **Technologies**: Push notification libraries (e.g., @react-native-firebase/messaging or expo-notifications), local storage (AsyncStorage), and conditional rendering for personalization.

### 4. Accessibility and Advanced AI (Accessibility Enhancements, Advanced AI & Feedback)

- **Requirements**: Voice guidance (TTS), screen reader support, haptic feedback, voice tagging (speech-to-text), confidence scores, and user feedback loops.
- **Technologies**: TTS/STT libraries (react-native-tts, react-native-voice), accessibility APIs (React Native props), enhanced ML models, and data collection for feedback.

### 5. Privacy and Timing Controls (Expanded Privacy Controls)

- **Requirements**: Expiration timers, granular privacy tiers, and opt-in notifications.
- **Technologies**: Timer APIs (setTimeout/setInterval), secure local storage, and notification scheduling.

### 6. General Infrastructure

- **Requirements**: State management, local data storage, navigation, and testing.
- **Technologies**: Zustand for state, AsyncStorage for storage, React Navigation, Jest for unit tests, and e2e testing (e.g., Detox).

## System Design Overview

- **Architecture**: Modular React Native app with component-based screens (e.g., CameraScreen, TagEditScreen). Use hooks for state/logic separation.
- **Data Flow**: Local-first (AsyncStorage for photos, tags, badges); optional server integration for post-MVP (e.g., feedback data syncing).
- **Scalability**: Epics as independent modules for sprint-based development (MVP in 4 sprints, post-MVP in 3-4).
- **Security/Privacy**: On-device processing with encryption; no mandatory data transmission.
- **Performance**: Optimize for mobile (lazy-load ML models, efficient gestures).
- **Testing**: Unit tests for components, e2e for flows (persona-based scenarios).
- **Dependencies**: Align with React Native CLI, TypeScript, NativeWind.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Native React Native with Custom Modules (Minimal Dependencies)

- **Description**: Use pure React Native CLI with custom native modules for camera/ML. Leverage built-in APIs for notifications/haptics.
- **Pros**: High performance, cost-effective, full control.
- **Cons**: Development complexity, platform-specific bugs.
- **Impact**: Excellent on-device performance; low cost but higher initial effort.

### Solution 3: Hybrid with Third-Party Libraries and Cloud Fallback (Balanced Scalability)

- **Description**: Mix libraries with optional cloud for AI (e.g., Firebase ML fallback).
- **Pros**: Flexibility, community support, scalability.
- **Cons**: Dependency bloat, privacy risks.
- **Impact**: Balanced performance; moderate cost, higher complexity.

## Recommendation

**Recommended Solution: Solution 1 (Native React Native with Custom Modules)**. This aligns with the project's React Native CLI setup and privacy emphasis, ensuring high performance for on-device AI and low costs. It supports the sprint structure and allows easy post-MVP enhancements. Start with MVP epics, testing on mid-tier devices. If needed, pivot to Solution 3 for hybrid flexibility.
