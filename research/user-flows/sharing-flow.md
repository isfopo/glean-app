## Design Notes

- **Mobile-First:** All screens are portrait-oriented, with touch targets >44px, swipe support.
- **Boho Aesthetic:** Earthy colors (#f0f8e8 background, #8b7355 borders), leaf icons for badges.
- **Accessibility:** High contrast, large fonts for users like Eleanor (67).
- **Privacy Emphasis:** On-device processing highlighted in tags screen.
- **No Transactions:** Focus on discovery connections, no purchase prompts.

## Alignment with Mission & Personas

- Supports intentional discovery for Maya (21), Alex (28), and Eleanor (67).
- Builds community without commercial incentives.
- Mermaid graph visualizes the non-linear permission step for clarity.
