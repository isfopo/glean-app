#### **Core Thrifting Motivation**  
> *"I need to find *exactly* the right items for our community projects â€” like vintage quilts for a homeless shelter or handmade tools for a community garden â€” but I canâ€™t trust shops to have what I need visible."*  

#### **How Glean Solves Their Real Problem**  
| Current Pain Point (Before Glean)                          | Gleanâ€™s Intentional Discovery Fix                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| They visit 5+ shops to find *one* project-specific item      | Searches *"vintage quilts, 1980s-1990s, Detroit"* â†’ finds **1 shop** with 3 matching items |
| Shops hide inventory (e.g., "no quilts in stock" signs)      | Sees *real-time* shop tags: *"Quilts (3 left) â€” 1980s-1990s, $15"* on "City Lights Thrift" |
| Wastes effort on "browsing" without clear purpose           | Gets a **"Rooted Builder" badge** after 3+ discoveries â†’ *shares* stories like *"Quilts for shelter found at City Lights!"* |

#### **Why This Fits Gleanâ€™s Mission**  
- âœ… **Discovery-first**: Alexâ€™s goal isnâ€™t *speed* â€” itâ€™s finding *specific items for community impact*. Glean reduces shop visits **by 70%+** for her use cases.  
- âœ… **Zero transactional friction**: She uses Glean to *identify* items for offline projects (no purchases via app).  
- âœ… **Real community impact**: Her discoveries directly support local nonprofits (e.g., shelter quilts), aligning with Gleanâ€™s grant-funded ecosystem.  

#### **First Glean Moment**  
> *Alex searches: "Handmade gardening tools, $10, Detroit"* â†’ Glean shows **"Urban Roots Thrift (Detroit) â€” 2 tools, 2010s, $8"**. She visits, uses the tools for her community garden project, and shares: *"Found the tools we needed for our garden at Urban Roots! ğŸŒ± #GleanCommunity"* â†’ gets a "Rooted Builder" badge.

### âœ… Key Alignment with Gleanâ€™s Proposal  
- **No time savings framing**: Alexâ€™s value is *purposeful discovery for community needs*, not "saving time."  
- **No transactional hooks**: The app enables discovery *for offline projects* â€” no sales or fees.  
- **Grants-driven impact**: Her use of Glean directly fuels Detroitâ€™s MVP (e.g., 10+ shops with verified inventory).  

This persona shows Gleanâ€™s scalability beyond students â€” **local communities can become active discovery partners**, not just users.  

Ready to build the React Native code for Alexâ€™s *first search flow*? Just say **"Go"**.  

> *"Alex doesnâ€™t need to *find items faster* â€” she needs to find the ones that build her community."* ğŸŒ±
