*21 | Junior at University of Michigan | Ann Arbor Resident*

#### **Core Thrifting Motivation**
> *"I don’t just want to *find* vintage items—I want to *intentionally* discover them for meaningful reasons. Like finding a 1990s Japanese art book for my literature class, or a handmade scarf for my sister’s winter gift. But right now, I waste so much time hunting for *one* thing at random shops."*

#### **How Glean Solves Her Real Problem**
| Current Pain Point (Before Glean)                          | Glean’s Intentional Discovery Fix                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| She visits 4+ shops to find *one* vintage denim jacket      | Uses Glean to search *"vintage denim jackets, 1990s-2000s, Ann Arbor"* → finds **1 shop** with 2 matching items in 10 mins |
| Shops hide inventory (e.g., "no visible scarves" on shelves) | Sees *real-time* shop tags: *"Handmade scarves (2 left)"* on Maple Street Thrift |
| Feels like she’s "just browsing" (no purpose)               | Gets a **"Rooted Finder" badge** after 3+ discoveries → *shares* stories like *"Found my sister’s perfect scarf at [Shop]!"* |

#### **Why This Persona Fits Glean’s Non-Profit Mission**
1. **Discovery-driven, not time-driven**: Maya’s goal isn’t *speed*—it’s finding *specific, meaningful items* for academic/social purposes. Glean reduces her shop visits **by 70%+** for her use cases.
2. **Zero transactional friction**: She doesn’t pay for Glean. Her "value" comes from *sharing discoveries* (e.g., posting on Instagram with #GleanStudent) → which aligns with Glean’s community goals.
3. **Gamification that serves discovery**: The "Rooted Finder" badge isn’t about rewards—it’s a *nudge to explore deeper* (e.g., "You found 3 local items—check out [Shop]’s new arrivals!").
4. **Real-world impact**: Her use of Glean directly supports Ann Arbor’s MVP (5+ shops) by adding *verified* inventory data to the ecosystem.

#### **Her First Glean Moment**
> *Maya opens Glean at 7 PM after a long day. She searches: "Handmade scarves, $10, under 2020."*
> → *Glean shows her 1 shop*: **"Bella’s Thrift (Ann Arbor) — 2 scarves, 1990s-2010s, $8"**
> → *She visits Bella’s Thrift*, finds the scarves, and shares: *"Found my sister’s perfect scarf at Bella’s! 🌿 #GleanStudent"* → *gets a "First Find" badge*.

### **Why This Persona Avoids Common Pitfalls**
| What You’d *Not* Do (Per Proposal)          | Why It Matters for Maya |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| ❌ Frame her as "saving time"               | → Glean’s value is *intentional discovery*, not time reduction |
| ❌ Assume she cares about "sustainability" as a *motivation* | → Her motivation is *meaningful connections* (e.g., gift for sister) |
| ❌ Include monetary transactions            | → She doesn’t *buy* via Glean—she discovers items *for potential offline purchases* |
| ❌ Make her a "sustainable student" cliché  | → Focus on *specific, actionable discoveries* (not vague eco-ideals) |

This persona is **tested against Glean’s core problem**: *The inability to intentionally discover specific items*. For Maya, it’s not about efficiency—it’s about turning thrifting from a chore into a purposeful, shareable act of discovery.

Ready to build the next step? I can draft **the first 10 lines of React Native code** for Maya’s "First Glean Moment" flow (photo upload → TensorFlow.js processing → Atproto publish). Just say **"Go"**.

> *"Maya doesn’t need to *save time*—she needs to find the scarf that matters."* 🌿
