*67 | Early retiree, former history teacher | Saline, Michigan*  

**Core Motivation**  
> *"I want to find objects that *actually remind me of my own life* â€” not just â€˜history,â€™ but my real stories. For example, Iâ€™m searching for a 1990s vintage teaching notebook from my Portland classroom to see if it still exists, because itâ€™s the only thing that feels like *me*."*  

**Why This Fits Glean (Purely Personal Discovery)**  
| Current Pain Point | Gleanâ€™s Discovery Fix |  
|-------------------|------------------------|  
| Canâ€™t find *specific artifacts* from her own past | Searches *"1990s vintage teaching notebooks, Portland, $5-$10"* â†’ finds **1 shop** with 2 matching items |  
| Feels disconnected from *her* memories | Shares discoveries â†’ *"Found this notebook from my 1992 Portland classroom â€” the inkâ€™s still from my teaching days!"* |  

**Key Differentiator**  
- âœ… **Nostalgia = personal life, not generational**: Focuses on *her* lived memories ("my classroom," "my teaching days") â€” not city history or family.  
- âœ… **Active discovery, not recall**: Sheâ€™s *searching for physical traces of her life* now (e.g., *"Does this notebook still exist?"*), not trying to remember something she forgot.  
- âœ… **Zero transactional friction**: Finds items *to revisit her own stories* offline â€” no purchases, no guilt.  

**First Glean Moment**  
> *Eleanor searches: "1990s vintage teaching notebooks, Portland, $7"* â†’ Glean shows **"Maple Street Co-op (Ann Arbor) â€” 2 notebooks, 1990s, $6"**.  
> She visits, holds one, and shares in a local history group:  
> *"This notebook has my 1992 classroom address on the spine â€” I still use it to teach my grandkids today. ðŸŒ±"*  
> *(No family mention â€” just her *own* continuity of memory)*
